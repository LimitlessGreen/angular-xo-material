Use `ng serve` to rapidly develop locally, taking advantage of file watching to compile and reload the development site. Use `ng build` to create a distribution and let Xo serve the site through the main domain without any additional server setup.

Once the theme has been built using `ng build` or `ng build --prod` the source folders are no longer necessary. A theme developer may opt to publish a theme built with Xo that does not include the source or build tools.
